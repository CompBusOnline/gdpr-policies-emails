Our community and vision for travel have grown significantly, so we're updating our Terms of Service (including the Experiences Additional Terms of Service), Payments Terms of Service, and Privacy Policy (collectively, "**Terms**"). The updated Privacy Policy will automatically come into effect for all existing users on 25 May 2018. Your continued use of the Airbnb Platform from that day on will be subject to the new Privacy Policy. The changes of the Terms of Service and the Payments Terms of Service will go into effect for all existing users on June 27, 2018. When you use Airbnb on or after that day, we'll ask you to agree to the new Terms of Service and Payments Terms of Service.

You can review the new Terms by clicking [here](https://www.airbnb.com.au/terms). We've also put up information to explain these changes in more detail on our [Terms of Service Update page](https://www.airbnb.com.au/home/terms-of-service-event). Both the old and new versions of the Terms can be found at the [Terms of Service](https://www.airbnb.com.au/terms), [Payments Terms of Service](https://www.airbnb.com.au/terms/payments_terms), and [Privacy Policy](https://www.airbnb.com.au/terms/privacy_policy), tabs through July 27, 2018. You should review these Terms in full yourself.
