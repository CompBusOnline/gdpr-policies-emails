Updates to our Privacy Policy and tools
=======================================

Hello,

Slack is committed to helping teams around the world work better, together. As part of our growth and in support of upcoming changes to EU data protection law, we're launching new tools and features and updating our [Privacy Policy](https://slack.com/privacy-policy-updated) and [User Terms](https://slack.com/terms-of-service/user-updated).

* * * * *

**Here's a quick summary of the changes:**

- **Improved clarity and transparency.** We've re-organized our Privacy Policy to make it clearer and more understandable, defined key terms, described our data processing practices and included examples showing how Slack implements this Policy.

- **GDPR updates.** The upcoming [General Data Protection Regulation](https://slack.com/gdpr) places new obligations on organizations that process EU personal data. As a result, we're updating our Privacy Policy and User Terms to better explain our relationship with our customers and users.

- **Tools and features.** We're introducing a [profile deletion tool](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/360000360443), updating our [import and export tools](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204897248-guide-to-slack-data-exports), and improving our [workspace settings center](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/360000355143) so you can see your team's plan, admins and settings.

* * * * *

We hope these updates will help make work a little more pleasant and productive, wherever you're based. Need assistance? Drop us a note at <feedback@slack.com>. And as always, thank you for using Slack.
