**We're updating our Privacy Policy**

Hello Envato community member,

You've probably been receiving lots of emails from companies notifying you of updates to privacy policies because of changes to EU data protection laws.

We've also updated our Privacy Policy to:

-   Give you more clear and detailed information about your collective rights and responsibilities with respect to your privacy and personal information.
-   Make it easier for you to control the information you provide us. You'll see that our policy explains your choices about this.
-   Provide more detail about the measures we have in place to keep your personal information secure.

You can read the full text of our Privacy PolicyÂ [here.](hhttps://envato.com/privacy-20180525)

The updated Privacy Policy automatically comes into effect for all Envato users on 25 May 2018. So your continued use of the Envato sites from that date will be subject to it.

Thanks again for being part of the Envato community!

Regards

Envato
