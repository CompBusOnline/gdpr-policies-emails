Hi USER,

This is Kate from the team at YouCanBook.me. 

This email is to help you understand how YCBM is compliant with GDPR, including info about our updated privacy and data protection policies. In addition, YCBM has features that will help you in your compliance with GDPR -- read until the end to learn how to use these features.

**As a UK company, we already protect your data to EU standards**, so this just updates our side as required.

For us, this is not just about the letter of the law, but the spirit that's intended -- namely, we are in the business of providing you with scheduling software so you can manage your time more easily. 

*We are not in the business of selling, sharing or misusing any data you share with us -- we will also take every step we can to protect your data from unauthorized access.*

Updated Privacy and Data Protection Notices
-------------------------------------------

Our privacy and data protection notices have been updated to include all the model clauses and data processing agreements both parties need when handling personally identified data. 

**What you need to do:** The next time you [log in](https://via.intercom-mail-100.com/e?https://app.youcanbook.me/#/login) to your YouCanBook.me account, you'll see these updated agreements (unless you've already logged in and clicked "accept"). When you accept them, we'll send you an email with a signed PDF of the statement and terms. These signed documents act as your GDPR agreement. 

**YCBM as Data Controller and Data Processor**

It's important to note that YouCanBook.me is the Data Controller for the information you give us when creating your account. But for the information that you gather from your bookers, on the booking form, you are the Data Controller and YouCanBook.me is the Data Processor.

Our updated terms comprehensively cover both of these situations. By reading, agreeing to, and clicking "accept" on them, you'll have entered into a contract with us that satisfies the requirements of GDPR in both areas.

**Data Retention Policy for Booking Data**

In Section 9 of our [Privacy Policy](https://youcanbook.me/privacy/) we describe how we hold and process data for individual bookings, by default, for up to 24 months after the date of the booking. Individual booking data will be automatically deleted after 24 months.  

**What you need to do:** Your account's data retention policy is set to 'never delete' by default, so we won't inadvertently delete any data you want to keep. By May 25th, you will be able to change this to a different retention duration. Look out for an email from us in a couple of week with more details on how to do that. 

YCBM Features Can Help You Be GDPR Compliant
--------------------------------------------

There are a number of features that you can use in your YouCanBook.me account when you are working to ensure your own compliance with GDPR. 

1.  **Booking form questions:** Make sure you are collecting only the information that you need for your appointments. Any *personally identifiable information* (PII) that you gather through your booking form is subject to GDPR, and this information will be added to your calendar as well as to YouCanBook.me. So think twice about the details that you require on your booking form.

2.  **Terms & conditions:** If you need your bookers to agree to your privacy policy, you can use a checkbox on the booking form that they must check before they book with you. We've created a guide on how to include this checkbox [here](https://support.youcanbook.me/article/370-adding-an-agree-to-terms-box-on-booking-form).

3.  **Data export:** All the information that you gather in your booking form can be exported to a CSV. Be sure you export only the data that you need by using our search feature to limit the data you access and remain compliant with your company's data standards. You can read more [here](https://support.youcanbook.me/article/75-view-and-export-your-booking-activity).

We understand everyone is working hard to meet the May 25 deadline set by GDPR and that we need to work together to be fully compliant. We will update you with any additional changes as they are required.

Thank you! 

Kate
