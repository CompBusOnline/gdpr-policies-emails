Notice of Policy Updates


Hello user,
As part of our ongoing effort to provide the best service to learners, we will be updating some of our policies. Effective May 15, 2018, updated Terms of Use, Privacy Policies, and Cookies Policy will be in place on Coursera. Please log in to your account today to review these policies. |

The purpose of these changes is to update our policies and procedures, which include bringing them in line with the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). While most of the changes will only affect residents of the European Economic Area ("EEA"), we encourage all learners to review the new policies and become familiar with them.

For your convenience, here is a brief summary of the changes to each policy. We encourage you to review each one in full. 

-   [Terms of Use](https://www.coursera.org/about/terms-gdpr)**: **Updated with references and links to the new Cookies Policy and further clarifications on our refund policy.

-   [Privacy Policies](https://www.coursera.org/about/privacy-gdpr)**: **The Privacy Policies have been updated to account for GDPR provisions. We've also made the policies more transparent by providing specific details on our data processing activities.

-   [Cookies Policy](https://www.coursera.org/about/cookies): Previously part of the Terms of Use, the Cookies Policy now stands alone as its own policy. The Cookies Policy covers Coursera's use of both internal and third-party cookies including: what cookies we use, what data third-parties collect, and your choices regarding cookies. You can also view our [Cookies Table](https://www.coursera.org/about/cookies-table), which provides a summary of some of the cookies we use.

For more information on our efforts for GDPR, please see our [Help Center article](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/360001842031).
