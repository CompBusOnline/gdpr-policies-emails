**We're updating our Privacy Policy**


Thanks for using Atlassian collaboration tools! We're constantly striving to provide a seamless, integrated experience to help your team work smarter and faster. To that end, we want to give you an overview of our updated privacy policy. It's more user-friendly and addresses new data regulations (includingÂ [GDPR](https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/purchase-licensing)).

Looking for a quick summary of the updates? Read on:



**Better navigation and user-friendly language.** To make the policy easier to understand, we use clear, plain language and examples that illustrate our activities. We reformatted our privacy policy page with active links, so you can quickly find the information that matters most to you.


**How we integrate our products.** We're always improving our products to give you a frictionless and customized experiencea. The updates to our policy describe the tools we've built to make our products smarter and allow you to move seamlessly from one Atlassian product to another.


**More control over your information.** We make it easy for you to control the information you provide to us. Our policy explains how you can make choices about your information, and the measures we've put in place to keep your information secure.


**Using our products for work.** Many users have access to our services through their organizations (e.g., their employers), who control their accounts or use of our services. The updated policy clarifies our relationship to these users and explains the tools available to administrators of these users.


The new privacy policy goes into effect on **May 25, 2018**. If you have any questions about these changes, take a look at the [FAQs](https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/purchase-licensing).
