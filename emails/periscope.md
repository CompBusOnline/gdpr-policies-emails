**Protecting your privacy.**

We believe you should always know what data we collect from you and how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control over both.

As part of our ongoing commitment to transparency, and in preparation for new EU data protection laws that take effect next month, we're updating Periscope's Privacy Policy and Terms of Service and consolidating them into Twitter's. We want to empower you to make the best decisions about the information that you share with us. 

You should read our new policy and terms in full, but the key updates include:

-One Privacy Policy and Terms of Service now covers both Periscope and Twitter; 
-The minimum age to use Periscope is 16 years old; 
-More focus on the controls we offer you over your personal data; 
-More clarity about how we share your data to prevent harm, comply with law, serve the public interest, and keep Periscope safe and welcoming for everyone. 


| The new [Terms](https://twitter.com/en/tos#update) and [Privacy Policy](https://twitter.com/en/privacy#update) will take effect on May 25, 2018.

Remember, you can use the controls we highlight in our updated policy to limit the information we collect about you or how we use it. You can also choose to deactivate your Periscope account. You have the final say about whether and how we process your personal data. 

Thank you for your trust and for being part of the Periscope Community!
