Hello,

You're receiving this email because we've updated our [Terms of Use](https://www.udemy.com/terms/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.udemy.com/terms/privacy/), which apply to all students and instructors on Udemy. We've made these updates to ensure that our terms are easier to understand and to keep up with evolving international data privacy standards.

Here's a quick summary of the changes:

-   **Simplified terms** - We've re-organized our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy to make them more clear and understandable. This reorganization hasn't changed your rights as a user, we've just made it easier to understand these rights.
-   **More clarity on our refund and credits policy** - Since factors like your payment method or device can affect your options under our 30-day guarantee, we've added additional detail about when we issue credits versus refunds.
-   **Data privacy updates** - As international data privacy standards evolve, particularly in the EU with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we've updated our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy to give you more control over your data and make it more clear how we use your data. All users, not just those in the EU, will have the same data privacy rights.

There is no action required on your end, we just wanted to inform you. Thank you for using Udemy!
