Hi USER,

We're updating our [User Privacy Notice](https://www.ebay.com.au/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-privacy-notice-privacy-policy?id=4260) to reflect changes we've made to strengthen your privacy rights. This is part of our ongoing commitment to be transparent about how we use your data and keep it safe. We have included changes to address the new standards introduced by the European data protection law known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Highlights of what's new:


- We've created easy-to-recognise icons that will help highlight privacy topics to make it easier for you to see how we use your personal information.

- We've added some detail around what you can do with your data and how you can exercise your privacy rights on eBay.

- We've given you additional information about when we delete your data.

- We'll provide increased transparency around the different purposes for which we use your personal information.

Keeping your data safe and increasing transparency are important to us, and we're committed to these changes. The new GDPR law goes into effect on 25 May 2018 and many eBay users around the world will benefit from the added privacy protections this law affords. You can learn more about our Privacy Principles, User Privacy Notice and how [GDPR](https://www.ebayinc.com/our-company/privacy-center/gdpr/) may apply to you at our [Privacy Centre](hhttps://www.ebay.com.au/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-privacy-notice-privacy-policy?id=4260).

Thank you for being a part of eBay,


The eBay Global Privacy Team
