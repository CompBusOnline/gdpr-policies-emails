### Trello Privacy Policy Updates

Thank you for trusting us with your personal information---we know it's a wild web out there and we value your choice to rely on Trello for your projects, goals, and teamwork. We are working hard to continue to earn your trust, and that's why we want to tell you about some new changes to our privacy policy.

As you may have heard from your other favorite apps, new data protection laws are being launched all over the world (including [GDPR](https://help.trello.com/article/1118-trello-and-gdpr-our-commitment-to-data-privacy) in Europe). To keep pace with these new laws, Trello, in collaboration with our new parent company, [Atlassian](https://blog.trello.com/trello-atlassian), is updating its privacy policy **effective May 25, 2018**. The new policy includes legal updates, is easier to read and navigate, and explains how we work together with Atlassian services and offerings in sharing data to improve your experience. You can take a look at the revised privacy policy [here](https://trello.com/privacy-updated).

**Here are some of the changes we are making to the privacy policy:**

-   **Improved navigation and more user-friendly language.** We've reformatted our policy with clearer language, headings, and links that allow you to find important information more easily. Where we can, we've added examples that illustrate our activities.
-   **More details on how we integrate our products and share information.** We are always working to improve our products, and the updates to our policy describe ways we've made our products more personalized, smarter, and more integrated with other products that you may use. The revised policy also explains how and why Atlassian and Trello share data.
-   **More control over your information.** We are making it easier for you to control the information you provide us. Our policy explains how you can make choices about your information and the measures we've put in place to keep your information secure.
-   **Trello at work.** You may have added an email address to your Trello account that is managed by a third party organization, like your employer. We have explained our relationship to these kinds of accounts, the tools available to managed account administrators, and the admin ability to claim and control accounts connected to managed email domains.

We look forward to continuing to be a part of your productivity. If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please reach out to our friendly support team by visiting *help.trello.com.*
