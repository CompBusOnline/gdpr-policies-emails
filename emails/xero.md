| Simpler, clearer info about your personal data |

 
Hi USER,

When you share your personal data with us, we treat it with care and take our responsibility to protect it seriously. That's why we've just updated our privacy notice to better communicate how we handle your personal data.

We've made changes so that it's:

-   clear, easy to read and simple to understand

-   open about how we collect, store, use and secure personal data

-   in line with Europe's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If you'd like to know more about what we're doing to get ready for GDPR, check out our [GDPR centre](https://www.xero.com/uk/campaigns/xero-and-gdpr/).

For a detailed summary of the changes, please see the new Xero privacy notice.

Thanks,
The Xero team
